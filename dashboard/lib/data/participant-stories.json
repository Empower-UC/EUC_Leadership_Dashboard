        "financialSituation": "Their family has faced significant financial challenges, living at the lowest level of poverty in a rural area, which has brought immense stress to their daily lives. With a family of five, including a disabled veteran spouse and three children, Tate has been navigating the complexities of making ends meet on a very tight budget. They rely on state programs and resources for assistance, while carefully managing every expense down to the penny. This has impacted the family\u2019s ability to build savings or handle unexpected costs, adding layers of stress that have taken a toll socially and emotionally.\nEmotionally, the strain of constantly working to stay afloat has made it difficult for Tate to find personal fulfillment outside of her roles as a wife and mother. The family\u2019s financial struggles have also limited their ability to engage in any social activities that many take for granted, leading to a sense of isolation at times. Despite these obstacles, Tate\u2019s commitment to her children\u2019s well-being, including their participation in school and karate, shows how she prioritizes their development even in the face of adversity. Her determination to create a better future for her family is remarkable, and her perseverance through difficult times is sure to set an example for her children.\n",
        "inspiration": "Tate\u2019s inspiration to take action and change her family\u2019s situation came from a deep desire to break the cycle of generational poverty and provide a more stable and secure future for her children. As her kids grew older, she became acutely aware of how their financial struggles were affecting them emotionally and socially, and she refused to let them face the same hardships she had experienced. Tate realized that simply getting by was no longer enough\u2014she wanted her family to thrive, not just survive.\nThis drive to create a better life for her children, combined with her own entrepreneurial spirit, pushed her to seek out programs like Empower. She recognized that, while her circumstances were challenging, she had skills and determination that could be channeled into something greater. By focusing on her strengths in creativity and design, as well as her ability to balance family responsibilities, Tate set out on a path toward financial independence and a more fulfilling life.",
        "challenges": "She encountered several challenges on her path, one of the most significant being burnout. As her business began to grow, the demands quickly escalated, and managing everything by herself became overwhelming. She had to learn how to balance the steady influx of work with the responsibilities of her home life, all while navigating her own mental and emotional limits. At times, it felt like there wasn\u2019t enough of her to go around.\nTo overcome these challenges, Tate made deliberate adjustments, like setting clear boundaries for her work hours and finding ways to delegate or simplify tasks. During this time, her husband\u2019s health was failing, so she took matters with the VA into her own hands, setting appointments for her husband on a consistent schedule, so she could advocate for him and ensure he got the care he needed to get better on her days off. With his health slowly improving now, she feels like she can breathe a little again. She also leaned into the resources and support offered by the Empower Program, which helped her focus on solutions rather than feeling trapped by the difficulties. This combination of practical strategies and emotional resilience allowed her to push through the obstacles and continue growing her business.\n",
        "lifeChanged": "With Tate being able to finish her degree and Empower has given her the extra support she needed to be able to do that."

Jasmine is ready and willing to work if they could find childcare for their 2 very young children, but the waitlists are so long and services are so expensive, it makes more sense for her to stay home.

She then saw that childcare was going to be a barrier to working. Chris had a good job at time of enrollment, but has a very long commute. Right after enrollment, his only vehicle broke down and Empower UC was ready and able to find a repair shop that would provide a free loaner and we paid for the repairs in total. Chris did not miss work due to the car situation and preserved his place in line for a promotion. Also, Chris was able to regain a positive standing with his student loans and take advantage of good programs for repayment that work with his income. ",

Chris has achieved the first level of his new promotion and is in line for the next 2 levels of the 3-step process. They also recently were married and able to celebrate their special day with friends and have a wedding they had been dreaming about for a long time. They have been successfully exited from the Empower UC program by exceeding 225% of the FPL and had the ability for covering their own healthcare through his employer sponsored plan by focusing on their financial goals through budgeting and preserving full-time employment. Using their continued Employment & Successful Exit Milestone, they were able to make more repairs themselves on their vehicle and now have full peace of mind on the long commutes and a vehicle for Jasmine and the children, too.
