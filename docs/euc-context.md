# EUC Program Context

## What Is EUC?
Empower Upper Cumberland is a $25M TANF-funded poverty alleviation pilot serving 14 rural Tennessee counties. One of 7 programs selected from 83 applicants. Goal: move families *out of* poverty, not just manage it.

## The Three Pillars

1. **Build Social Capital** — Connect families to networks that provide job leads, interest-free emergency loans, and system navigation

2. **Remove Structural Barriers** — Eliminate benefit cliffs where earning more costs you money

3. **Combine Knowledge + Cash** — Financial literacy means nothing without actual liquidity to manage

## Delivery Mechanisms

- **Navigator-led coaching** — Relationship-driven change (18-24 months per family)
- **Timely financial assistance** — Clearing cognitive bandwidth
- **Career pathway partnerships** — Skills + employer connections
- **Whole-family support** — Addressing the full system (two-generation approach)

## Five Stages of Prosperity

1. **Crisis Intervention** — Emergency response
   NOTE: Families in active crisis (e.g., facing eviction) are NOT accepted at intake—must be stabilized first

2. **Stabilization** — Foundation building (housing, healthcare, childcare)

3. **Job Readiness** — Training, skills, cliff planning

4. **Placement** — Employment, job networks

5. **Advancement** — Career growth, graduation at 225% FPL

## Key Definitions

- **225% FPL** — Federal Poverty Level threshold for "graduated" (~$70K for family of 4)
- **Benefits cliff** — Loss of benefits when income rises slightly, often leaving families worse off
- **TennCare** — Tennessee's Medicaid program
- **ALICE** — Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed (working but struggling)
- **Cognitive bandwidth** — Mental capacity consumed by constant survival decisions; poverty reduces this

## Program Nuances

### Participant Payments
- **Milestone payments**: Cash for achievements. IMPORTANT: Year 1 milestones were poorly designed (e.g., "attended session = $50"). Later restructured to reward real progress. Interpret milestone data with caution.
- **Emergency fund**: Up to $5K per family for crises (rent, meds, school). Separate from milestones. Most families use within first 2-3 months.

### Enrollment
- Still enrolling but at reduced rate
- No crisis intervention at intake—families facing active crisis are not accepted until stabilized

### Control Group
- Program had A/B design (A = full services, B = cash only for year 1)
- Year 1 was chaotic—Group B actually outperformed A due to implementation issues
- **IGNORE A/B designation in all analysis. Treat as one cohort.**
